Freisch√ºtz Digital topicMap Visualization
=========================================

FreiDi:topicMapViz can run independently as mere HTML and Javascript application and thus be served with almost no needs to a server.
It is intended for vizualizing JTM topic maps.

For development purposes it can be built and served with bower and grunt, a respective test topic map is included as the application is tailored to our data.

Moreover a ant script for building a eXist-db application is included. In the eXist based setup the tm-converter stylesheets by Lars Heuer (published at https://code.google.com/p/topic-maps/ under Apache License 2.0) will be used for transfroming XTM 2.0 topic maps to JTM 1.1 specification. In order to include theses script you need SVN installed as the repository will be checked out via bower install.
